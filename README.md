# Virtual Water Trade Project - Week 2 Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains the Week 2 exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the Virtual Water Trade project. 

## Overview

- Data loading and initial exploration of the virtual water trade dataset
- Distribution analysis of key virtual water metrics such as export and import volumes, trade value, and water intensity
- Visualization of trade type distributions and volume relationships
- Handling missing data and feature engineering (net virtual water trade balance)
- Correlation analysis to inform feature selection for predictive modeling

## File Descriptions

- `week2_virtual_water_trade_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the Week 2 EDA, including data visualization and transformation steps.
- `virtual_water_trade.csv`: Dataset containing virtual water trade records (ensure this file is placed in the repo or accessible).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and required packages installed:
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook in the repo directory:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open and run the `week2_virtual_water_trade_eda.ipynb` notebook.

## Next Steps

- Use the features identified here to build predictive models in Week 3.
- Expand data insights and perform clustering or forecasting in subsequent phases.
